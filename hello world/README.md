### Hello, world!

<i>"Hello World is a simple program that, when run, displays the message: Hello World. The most likely historical explanation is simply that a short program like Hello World once allowed the programmer to make sure that a language's compiler, development environment, and run-time environment were correctly installed."</i>

### How to set up your Arduino?

- Go to Software | Arduino
- Download Software for your OS
- Connect your Arduino to your PC

Once you open Arduino Software:
- Go to Tools/Boards Manager and find your Arduino model
- Find and select your port

SETUP IS DONE.

### After configuring your Arduino

You can Copy and Paste the .ino code and press the arrow icon to run and verify your code!
That's pretty much it, now you have Arduino that can auto-type "Hello, world" in notepad when plugged in.
